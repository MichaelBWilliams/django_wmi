The individual country pages display the available mapping themes, which have been selected as relevant to the MFI and include links for downloading each of these map sets. While the number of individual maps availabe for each country varies, the entire VisionFund map catalog includes nearly <b>2,000 maps</b>. If you would like to see more information about the data used to generate these maps or request additional mapping related to your MFI, please see the <b><a href="/resources">Data Links</a></b> page or go to the <b><a href="/contact">Contact</a></b> page.

These themes are sourced from WorldClim.org and cover the following nine important variables: Dependability of rainfall, annual precipitation, precip. of wettest and driest month, precip. of wettest and driest quarter, max temp of warmest month, min temp of coldest month, and average monthly precip. These maps are intended to be used in conjunction with other datasets to assist operations staff in making complext decisions.</p>
